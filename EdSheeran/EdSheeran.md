# Ed Sheeran

I wish I were Ed Sheeran for the _'One'_,\
I'd _'Sing'_ _'Thinking Out Loud'_ to her.

I'll ask her to _'Sing'_ _'Give me Love'_.\
Even if she sang of offkey,\
I know It will be _'Perfect'_ for me.

I know she is from _'The A team'_ of angels in heaven.\
I always think of her as the Angel of the _'Lego House'_ we build.

I imagine us as a couple in the streets of _'Barcelona'_.\
Where she is delighted by _'The City'_,\
And I had already _'Dive'_ into her blue eyes.\
She is dancing in the streets like a _'Galway Girl'_,\
With the _'Supermarket Flowers'_ I bought for her

Imagination may sound _'Happier'_.\
Because of the _'Afire Love'_ I contain in my heart for her.\
But in reality _'I'm a Mess'_.\
I am 'Drunk' all day long and cry all night\
Looking at the one blur _'Photograph'_ of her\
That I stole from _'Nancy Mullighan'_.

I still remember when I first saw her in _'Grade 8'_.\
And I felt something in my _'Bloodstream'_.

_'What Do I know?'_ about her,\
I keep asking myself this question while smoking, sitting on the roof of the _'Castle on the Hill'_\
Wondering _'How would you feel?'_ when you see me like this.

Whenever I close my eyes and try to get over you,\
_'Shape of You'_ becomes more vivid.

_'I see the fire'_ over the cigarette.\
I want to be a _'New Man'_.\
I want to _'Save Myself'_.

Hence, I am searching for the _'Eraser'_\
Which can erase you from my memories.

I _'Don't'_ know whether it's an end or a beginning.\
But what I know is that _'All of the Stars'_ weren't aligned,\
When you _'Cross Me'_.
