# Faithful Fan
At 5 in the evening alone in the house lying on the bed looking at the ceiling, observing the fan, and listening to that periodic sound of it. Thinking about the theories of frequency, function, poems, and chapters of literature where a fan has been observed creatively and transformed in the form of words, trying failed efforts he could figure out something poetic about the fan. What all he could notice was that faithful frequent sound and that controlled speed of it. Like the fan, his thoughts were stuck and rotating about the same axis. With each revolution of the fan, his head was getting heavier. He feels like he needs to take a nap but also finds himself doing nothing productive. If he chooses to take the nap he will be full again but what's the guarantee. If he gets up and switches the fan off and does something that he thinks is productive, what is the guarantee he will be fully there for as long as he wants?

His life is analogous to the fan, the productive he thinks is switch on state for the fan and where he is making that periodic effort of trying to do things ideally. His sleep makes him feel whole but is unable to do anything productive just like a switch-off fan.

It's 7 in the evening, opening his eyes, experiencing a headache is giving a slight thought on what he concluded about his fan analogy situation which is overcome by the spectrum of thoughts.
