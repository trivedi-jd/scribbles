# The Faithful Fan
At 5 in the evening alone in the house lying on the bed looking at the ceiling, observing the fan and listening to that periodic sound of it. Thinking about the theories of frequency, function, the poems and chapters of literature where fan has been observed creatively and transformed in form of words, trying failed efforts if he could figure out something poetic about the fan. What all he can notice was that faithful frequent sound and that controlled speed of it. Like the fan, his thoughts were stuck and rotating about the same axis. With each revolution of fan, his head was getting heavier. He feels like he need to take nap but also finds himself doing nothing productive. If he chooses to take the nap he will be full again but what's the guarantee. If he gets up and switches the fan off and do something what he thinks he productive, what is the guarantee he will be full there for as long as he wants.

His life is analogous with the fan, the productive he thinks is switch on state for fan and where  he is making that periodic effort of trying to do things ideally. And his sleep is making him feel whole but is unable to do anything productive just like a switch off fan.

It's 7 in the evening, opening his eyes,experiencing a headache is giving a slight thought on what he concluded about his fan analogy situation which is overcome by the spectrum of thoughts.
