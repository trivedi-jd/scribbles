GitHub repo to have my writing version controlled.

## Guide to Read my Scribbles
1. ___This is not an empty repo___ _(For those who are not versed with GitHub)_
2. All branches have the corresponding piece in it.
3. One must navigate to the branch and use the `Go to file` option.
4. Find the respective folder and you can read the piece with `<XYZ>.md` file.
5. This repo is _read-only_. Except for _trivedi-jd_ (me).
