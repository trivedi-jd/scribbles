Moonlight

When the Moonlight falls
And I find myself alone
I want an endless road to ride a bike on
Which leads me to the destination that calls.

Let a camera follow me
Let all the songs on my playlist play one by one
I will be the character it talks about
and relive the story it holds.

Then, I will think about the dreams that I want to see when sleep arrives
Dreams of what my life would be if not for those mistakes.
Dreams that always end up getting disturbed because of the coward I had been then.

I don't know
But when the Sunlight falls
I am new again
I am confident and braver
I am now, Who I wasn't yesterday.

Though every night when the Moonlight falls
And I find myself alone
I hold a camera to record the dreams I wish to see
But the film in the roll isn't long enough that I can watch them undisturbed.
