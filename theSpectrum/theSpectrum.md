# The Spectrum

In the middle of a slight headache, a boy is sitting in a room looking outside the closed window. A spectrum of thoughts is being processed in parallel fashion and on the loop.

Thoughts about opening the window, about getting out of room,
about her mother who's not receiving her call being 1000 miles away, about the beautiful girl he met in the noon but couldn't speak a word, about the life he is living, about the life he will be living, about the character he is playing or about the character that he will be playing. 

All this in his head and then he takes a sip of tea with the tango music he loves, all of a sudden, gradually he is feels he is coming back to life. The Spectrum of thoughts finds the way through and reaches their new destination to the unconscious brain with confirm return ticket. And suddenly his phone rings. The boy looks outside the open window while having a conversation on phone. He wishes to get transported to other side.

At the end of the call, he senses that spectrum is again trying to reach its initial location but this time he looks at them with a different approach. 

The Day ends so the cup of tea...
