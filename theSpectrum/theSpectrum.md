# The Spectrum

In the middle of a slight headache, a boy is sitting in a room looking outside the closed window. A spectrum of thoughts is being processed in parallel and on loop in his mind.

Thoughts about opening the window, about getting out of the room,
about her mother who's not receiving her call being 1000 miles away, about the beautiful girl he met in the noon but couldn't speak a word, about the life he is living, about the life he will be living, about the character that he is currently playing or about the one that he will be playing. 

All this turbulence in his head, and then finally, he decides to takes a sip of tea. He plays the tango music he loves in the background while having few sips. All of a sudden, he starts to realise that he is coming back to life. The Spectrum of thoughts finds its way through and reaches its new destination to the unconscious brain with a confirmed return ticket. 

He picks up his phone that just happened to ring. The boy looks outside the open window while having conversation on his phone. He wishes to get transported to the other side of the phone. "It's such a pity!" he thinks, "the science and technology haven't reached that level of advancement yet."

At the end of the call, he senses that the spectrum of thoughts is trying to reach its initial location again. However, this time he has a different approach to look at them.

The Day ends so the cup of tea...
